    To write a text adventure, you need to create and upload a YAML script to somewhere that's accessible on the web (e.g., [gist](https://gist.github.com)).

    To get an idea of how a script should look like, see [`demo.yaml`](demo.yaml).

    (Also, you can validate your YAML file at [yaml-json-repl](https://remarkablemark.org/yaml-json-repl/).)

  This concludes the demo.

  Go [play](.) a text adventure!
